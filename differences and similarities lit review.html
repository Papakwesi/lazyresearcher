          <h3>Introduction</h2>
            <p >
              A research is the process of acquiring knowledge through a careful and detailed study. Literature review aids researchers find out established research works prior to undertaking their own research work. In conducting a research there are many aspects that have to be done for a research to be complete. One of this aspects is the Literature Review. In this section we are going to look at some of the differences and similaries between the types of literature review.

            <h3>Differences and similarities between narrative and integrative review</h3>
            <p>
              Literature review is a background search on available information on a particular topic. Two of the most popular types are the narrative and integrative reviews. A narrative review is a critically analyzed and comprehensive review on the weaknesses and strengths of a research work. This type of research is in a narration form and aids researchers in creating a theoretical framework, identify gaps in previous studies, informs readers and other researchers on recent knowledge in a particular topic and shows the importance of new studies. The integrative review is also a type of review that critiques, assess and synthesizes literature on a researches in an integrated way such that a researcher gains other viewpoints on a topic. This type of review is usually used in socialscience researches. Narrative and integrative reviews are similar in many ways. Both reviews focus on critiquing previous researches in order to find their strengths and weaknesses. Thiscritiquing helps researchers to find gaps in previous works that help them to have other perspectives on their topics of research. Also, both reviews emphasize on using gaps in the reviews to help researchers establish the theoretical framework of a research. A theoretical framework includes concepts derived from literature review used in a researcher’s work to support their theory. Integrative review do not apply to researches which involve primary data collection and analysis. Focus is given to only secondary data in this review. However, narrative researches tend to analyze both primary and secondary data collection and analysis. Also, integrative reviews allows researchers use secondary data collection and analysis from other researches to create new knowledge in their researches whereas narrative reviews use primary data to inform other researchers on the weaknesses in previous researches.

            <h3>Differences between Scoping Review and Systematic Review</h3>
            <p>
              Scoping and Systematic literature reviews are two of the commonly known ways to undertake a literature review. Scoping review can be defined as a type of review that seeks to explore a research topic in a particular field where not enough empirical literature is available. This type of review seeks to use research to create new knowledge. Systematic review on the other hand is atype of review that finds important available researches, evaluates its quality and merges the findings to have a coherent results. Scoping and systematic reviews are similar and different in several ways. One main difference between scoping and systematic reviews is their scope of research topics. The range of topics under scoping reviews are usually broad while systematic reviews have a narrow scopes. Rather than focus on a research question in a particular topic, scoping reviews go further to investigate the research question in other topics of research. Also, scoping and systematic reviews differ on what they seek to achieve. Since scoping review are usually done in areas that a have very limited empirical literature, the major aim of this type of review is to create new knowledge and answer particular research topics. However, systematic reviews seek to compile secondary literatures in a coherent way to evaluate them. It does not aim at answering research topics. A main similarity between scoping and systematic review is that procedure involved in the research. A similar search approaches, instructions, a step by step approach, transparency and format are employed in writing both reviews. Also, both researches identify gaps in previous researches which aids in the planning of current research and informs future researchers of future research topics.
